        <h1>How to Play Chess</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating colors of squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces: 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, and 1 king.</li>
            <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning their king is in a position where it can be captured and no legal moves can avoid this.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic Moves:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pawns:</strong> Move forward one square (or two squares on their first move). Pawns capture diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rooks:</strong> Move any number of squares vertically or horizontally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Knights:</strong> Move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bishops:</strong> Move diagonally across the board.</li>
                    <li><strong>Queens:</strong> Move any number of squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kings:</strong> Move one square in any direction.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Special Moves:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Castling:</strong> The king and one of the rooks move simultaneously, provided neither piece has moved before and there are no pieces between them.</li>
                    <li><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur immediately after an opponent moves their pawn two squares forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the far end of the board, it is promoted to any piece except a king (usually a queen).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Endgame:</strong> The game ends when one player checkmates the other player's king. A game can also end in a draw under certain conditions.</li>
        </ol>
